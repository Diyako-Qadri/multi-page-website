Hi Diyako!

Nice work, I can see you've spent a lot of time on this and worked really hard to understand how it all works.

As you can see below there are a few things that can be fixed up. I would like you to try to fix them just for your own understanding but there is no need to resubmit.

This is really good for your first assignment. Välgodkänt, very well done.

CRITERIA FOR GRADING

*************************************

GODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

3 separate pages: ✔
   Check the "main-content section" on the home and contact pages - it gets a white bar across the page because "overflow" is set to scroll. Scroll means a scroll bar ALWAYS will be rendered on the screen - try "overflow: auto" instead. Auto means the scroll bar will only be rendered if it is needed.

A header with a page title on every page: ❌✔
   Every single page needs one and only one <h1> tag. The content has to be unique. You can style the <h1> to look however you want, but you need to have just one <h1> on every page. 

A navigational menu every page with links to the other pages: ✔
   No About Us page!

Contact form: ✔
    Email: ✔
    Message: ✔
    Required: ✔
    Mail to: ✔

RWD:
    Desktop: ✔
    Mobile: ✔

External CSS: ✔

-------------------------------------

VÄLGODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

Current page indication in the menu: ❌
   Add an "active" class or somesuch.

Responsive Image:

RWD:
  Media Query: ✔
  Flex/Grid: ✔

Separate CSS: ✔ ❌
  Nice work with headerfooter.css, but there is duplicated content in the files. The first rul of coding is "if you do it twice then you can do it in a better way". Things like html, body and .main styling are repeated in every file - they should be in a "global" stylesheet.
  Semantic: ✔

Semantic Element naming: ✔

Code Style:
  HTML: ✔
  CSS: ✔ A few empty lines and missed indentations but pretty good!
